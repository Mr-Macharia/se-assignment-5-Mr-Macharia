Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 10 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.

   - Before you begin the installation process, make sure that your Windows 10 operating system is up-to-date with the latest updates installed.
   - Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the official Visual Studio Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - On the homepage, click the "Download for Windows" button under the Download section.
   - Depending on your system architecture e.g 32-bit , the appropriate installer will be downloaded automatically.
   - Once the installer download is complete, locate the downloaded file and double-click on it to begin the installation process.
   - On the Welcome screen, click "Next" to proceed.
   - On the next screen, you will be presented with the License Agreement. Review the terms, check the "I accept the agreement" box, and click "Next."
   - In the following screen, you can choose the installation location for Visual Studio Code. Unless you have specific requirements, it's recommended to use the default location by clicking "Next."
   - On the next screen, you can choose whether to create a desktop shortcut for Visual Studio Code. It's recommended to select this option for convenient access. Click "Next" to continue.
   - On the subsequent screen, you can choose to add Visual Studio Code to the PATH environment variable. This option is recommended as it allows you to run Visual Studio Code from the command prompt or terminal without specifying the full path. Select the appropriate option and click "Next."
   - Review the installation summary, and if everything looks correct, click "Install" to begin the installation process.
   - The installation may take a few minutes to complete. Once done, you will see a final screen indicating that Visual Studio Code has been successfully installed. Click "Finish" to close the installer.
   - You can now launch Visual Studio Code by clicking on the desktop shortcut (if you chose to create one during the installation) or by searching for "Visual Studio Code" in the Windows Start menu and selecting the application.


2. First-time Setup:
   
   After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
   - Go to "File" > "Preferences" > "Settings" (or use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+,").
   - In the "Search settings" bar, type "theme" to find and select your preferred editor theme (e.g., Dark+ or Light+).
   - Search for "font" and adjust the font family, size, and line height to your liking.
   - In the Settings window, search for "auto save" and check the "Files: Auto Save" option. This will automatically save your changes as you code, preventing accidental data loss.
   - Open the Command Palette by pressing "Ctrl+Shift+P" and type "File: Install 'code' command in PATH".
   - Select the option to install the "code" command, which will allow you to open files and directories in VS Code from the command prompt.
   - Open the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the left sidebar or by pressing "Ctrl+Shift+X". Search for and install the following popular extensions:

      - Bracket Pair Colorizer: Adds colorization to matching brackets for better visibility.
      - Live Server: Launches a local development server with live reload for static and dynamic pages.
